# Deep reinforcement algorithms
Implementations of classic Deep RL algorithms, mostly based on CS 294: Deep
Reinforcement Learning at [Berekley](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse-fa17/index.html)

Current state:
- [X] Policy Gradient:

      Basically my solution to heavily refactored CS294 second homework. Tensorflow ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
- [ ] DQN

      Still based on CS294 but implemented in  PyTorch ✧ﾟ･: *ヽ(◕ヮ◕ヽ)
   + [X] Discrete action space
   + [ ] Continous action space

## Solved classic control environments:
